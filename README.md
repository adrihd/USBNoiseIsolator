# USBNoiseIsolator
A concept USB Noise Isolator for the DAC and SDA Community

This is just a proof of concept which I'm working on at the moment.

The main issue is that most of the isolators rely on either:

1. Transformers: Which can be noisy and prone to carrying over the noise from the primary windings
2. Opto-isolators: e.g. Optocouplers, which appear the be the better method, but they lack switching speed, limiting the data transfer of the USB line

With a healthy set of data logic and more, I'm trying to speed up the second option above...

Fingers crossed!

Any contributers which offer positive and helpful additions and/or changes are welcome to the project...
